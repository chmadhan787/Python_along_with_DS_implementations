#what is a data structure ?
# data structure is a storage used to store and organize data.it is the way of arranging data on computer
# so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently
# data structures is not only used for organising data but also used for processing,retrieving and storing of that data
# there are different basic and advanced types of datastructures which are used in almost every program or
# software that has been developed. so, we must have a good knowledge about data structures .

#classification of datastructures :
#it is classified into two types based on their appearance as linear and non linear data structures
# in linear data structures we have static i.e, array and dynamic i.e, linkedlist,queue,stack
# in non linear data structures we have tree,graph
# LINEAR : data structures in which elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element
# is connected to next and/or previous element , is called as linear data structures
# STATIC : static data structures have fixed size of memory, it is easier to access elements in static
# data structures
# DYNAMIC : in dynamic data structure ,the size is not fixed .it can be randomly updated during the runtime
# which may be considered efficient concerning the memory(space) complexity of the code
# NON-LINEAR :datastructures in which the data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly
# but in case of non linear datastructures we cannot traverse all the elements in the single run only
#
#how data structures varies from data types?
#refer intro to data structures notes
#
# by using data structures ,one can organize and process very large amount of data in a relatively short period
#
#
# NEED OF DS :
# - data structure provides data representation which is easy to understand for the developer and the user
# can make an efficient implementation of the operation
# - data structures can provide an easy way of organizing ,retrieving ,managing and storing data
# here is a list of needs of data structures :
# 1.Data structures modification is easy
# 2.it requires less time
# 3.saves storage memory space
# 4.Data representation is easy
# 5.it provides easy access to large data base.



# data structures are the integral part of computers used for the arrangement of data in the memory
# they are essential and responsible for organizing ,processing ,accessing , and storing data efficiently.

#Data stuctures are the building blocks  or raw material for any software programs
#one cant become a good programmer without sound understanding of datastructures
#data structures are containers ,storing data in a specific memory layout

#BIG O NOTATION:
# it is used to measure how running time and space requirements for your program increases as your input size grows
# the mathematical representation of time required by a program according to size of input is BIG O NOTATION
# this BIG O NOTATION can be used for all programming languages , it is not specific to python programming
# Measuring running time growth is called : time complexity
# Measuring space growth is called: space complexity
# in big o notation generally worst case is most important
# worst case complexity of binary search is O(logn)
# cpu uses ram to store presently executing code variables and data
