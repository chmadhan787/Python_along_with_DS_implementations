import math
#also we can also import math as m and we can we use m where we use math
#also we can import only required functions for program like
#from math import sqrt,pow
x=math.sqrt(25)
print(int(x))
y=math.pow(5,2)
print(y)
#when we use floor even the value is 2.9 we get a value as 2
#if we use even if we have value 2.1 we will get output as 3

#it is always better to use functions than operators
